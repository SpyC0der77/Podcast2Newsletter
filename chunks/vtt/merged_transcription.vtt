00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:7,920
 Good morning and welcome to Kid News! I'm Tori. Today is Friday, December 13th, 2024.

00:00:7,920 --> 00:00:14,320
 And we begin with a timely and somewhat spooky vocabulary quiz. What's the word for fear

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,000
 of the number 13? Triska Decafobia. How about fear of today? Friday the 13th. That's

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,920
 even more of a mouthful. Paraskevy Deca-Triaphobia. No one is entirely sure when or where worries

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,480
 about something bad happening on this day began, but it's clearly real enough that it's been

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,880
 given a name and been studied. What did the researchers find? When asked by NBC News, a University

00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,680
 of Helsinki scientist was very matter of fact. No data exists and will never exist to confirm

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,800
 that 13 is an unlucky number. And that's good news for SpaceX, which is scheduled to launch

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:59,280
 a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral tonight. It's a football stunner. Legendary Coach Bill

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:5,280
 Bellicek is taking his eight Super Bowl championship rings to his new job as head coach at the University

00:01:5,280 --> 00:01:12,640
 of North Carolina. Bellicek's deal is reportedly worth $50 million over five years and comes as UNC

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,320
 looks to revamp its football program. It's a homecoming of sorts and looks to be a family affair.

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,400
 Bellicek's dad coached for a few years at UNC and Bellicek's own son Steve, who coaches at

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,760
 the University of Washington, is expected to join him on his squad. Since leaving the Patriots,

00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,120
 the 72-year-old had been dipping his toe into broadcasting and was rumored to seek a return to

00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:42,960
 the NFL. With 333 NFL wins, he's just 15 away from breaking the all-time career record.

00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:51,040
 President-elect Trump is Times' person of the year. For 97 years, the magazine has been

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,480
 handing out the title, which goes to the individual who, for better or for worse, did the most to

00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:1,600
 shape the world and the headlines over the past 12 months. An announcing its decision time

00:02:1,600 --> 00:02:8,560
 wrote, in many years, that choice is a difficult one. In 2024, it was not. Mr. Trump celebrated by

00:02:8,560 --> 00:02:13,280
 ringing the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. It's the second time he's

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,360
 been named person of the year. The first was in 2016. While many people have been given the title twice,

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,800
 only Franklin Delano Roosevelt has won it three times.

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,480
 An Arctic blast is sending a shiver down the spines of millions across the U.S.

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,360
 Below freezing temperatures are part of a powerful cold front stretching from Maine all the way

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,040
 down to Florida and across parts of the Midwest, where wind gusts and bone-chilling weather are expected.

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,880
 With the cold, often-come seasonal illnesses like COVID and for some it doesn't quit. To find

00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,400
 connection and healing, some kids have joined the long COVID kids' choir, a group where music

00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:0,720
 seems to be the best medicine. The virtual group meets on Sundays to sing and share their struggles.

00:03:0,720 --> 00:03:5,600
 Participation varies depending on the energy levels of the members, says San Francisco member

00:03:5,600 --> 00:03:10,800
 Anuk Shilam. A great thing about the choir is there's no pressure to join if you don't feel like it.

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,880
 And even if you do join, if you don't feel like doing something that's okay, you can sit it out.

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,400
 The choir just released a powerful new song, Roller Coaster, to give voice to the up and down ride

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
 many kids living with long COVID are forced to endure.

00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,520
 An A Teen Chess Prodigy Just Made History

00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,160
 18-year-old Gukesh Domaraju of India now holds the crown as the youngest world chess champion ever

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,400
 after a nail-biting finale in Singapore. Yesterday's win came down to an apparent mistake by his 32-year-old

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,720
 opponent in the final match, giving Gukesh the win, a big slice of the $2.5 million prize,

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,320
 and the distinction of breaking Gary Casparov's 39-year record as the youngest title holder.

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,640
 Up next, following through on a bet he made with his chess coach last week,

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:2,000
 Bungie jumping off a bridge despite his fear of heights.

00:04:4,640 --> 00:04:10,160
 Still to come, it wasn't a triple dog dare, but the embarrassing result was the same.

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,960
 But first, we want to wish an early happy 11th birthday to the amazing and brilliant

00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,720
 Lila Skaronic of Durham, North Carolina. Lila, your family is inspired by your fierce kindness,

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,000
 your voracious love of reading, your passion for learning about World War II, your entrepreneurial

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,280
 spirit, your musical theater talents as an actor, singer, and dancer, and your dedication to your

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,720
 future career as a teacher. Happy early birthday, Lila! Now, the kid news quiz.

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,720
 What's the word for Fear of Friday the 13th?

00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,040
 Pereskevy Dekka Triaphobia. At which university will Bill Bellachek coach?

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:2,800
 The University of North Carolina. How old is the world's newest and youngest world chess champion?

00:05:7,760 --> 00:05:14,160
 18. What song did the long COVID Kids Choir release to raise awareness about their condition?

00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,000
 16. Roller Coaster

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,080
 In our kid news kicker, it doesn't just happen in a Christmas story. A grown man in Australia

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,560
 couldn't help himself. He just had to stick his tongue out and lick an ice sculpture,

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,240
 put up to advertise an energy drink at a mall in Sydney. If you remember what happened to Ralfey's

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,800
 friend, Flick, you know what happened to this poor guy. With people walking all around him,

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,640
 he found himself stuck by his tongue to the display. A security guy tried to free him by pouring

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,720
 warm water over his tongue to melt the ice. It didn't work. News.com in Australia isn't sure how

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,080
 long the ordeal lasted, but it was long enough for the energy drink company to post. We never

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:3,520
 thought we'd have to say this, but don't lick ice sculptures in public. Thanks again to the

00:06:3,520 --> 00:06:9,360
 scheronics of Durham North Carolina for sponsoring today's quiz. Happy birthday of it early to Lila!

00:06:9,440 --> 00:06:14,480
 Hello to her sister Edith and shoutouts to Lila's teachers, Ms. Neff, Ms. Cameron,

00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,480
 and Ms. Penny at Ephesus in Chapel Hill. We also want to recognize her other kid news classrooms,

00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:27,120
 Ms. Pashka and her eagles at Midway School in Cincinnati, Ohio. Mrs. Zanatakis and her hawks at

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,960
 Frank H. Hammonschool in Munster, Indiana, and Mr. Scott and his dolphins at Samantha Smith School

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,960
 in Samamish, Washington. And that's a pre-holiday wrap for our kid news team. We're taking the next

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,000
 three weeks off to spend with family and friends, and we hope you all get to do the same.

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:54,880
 Stay safe, have fun, and we'll see you back here for more kid news on Monday, January 6, 2025.
